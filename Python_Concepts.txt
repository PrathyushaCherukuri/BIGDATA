Logging : 
tracking of events that happens when some software runs.

Python logging levels:
Debug : These are used to give detailed information, 
       typically of interest only when diagnosing problems.
info : These are used to confirm that things are working as expected.
Warning : These are used an indication that something unexpected 
       happened or is indicative of same problem in the near future.
Error : This tells that due to a more serious problem, the software
       has not able to perfrom some function.
Critical : This tells serious error, indicating that the program 
        itself may be unable to continue running.
