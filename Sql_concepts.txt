SQL Merge Statement

Incremental Load : Copy data from db to datalake from the last load. 
Full Load : Copy all data from db to datalake

My Research Concepts:

SCD - Slowly Changing Dimensions
    SCD Type 0: Retain orginal (no changes allowed once created)
    SCD Type 1: Overwrite (no history kept, correcting errors)
    SCD Type 2: New row is inserted for every change (history is preserved)
    SCD Type 3: Add new attribute (Partial history, Store limited history by adding extra columns)
    SCD Type 4: History table(Changes recorded in separate history table)


UNION : Does not includes duplicates
UNION ALL : includes duplicates
Views : Do not stores data, runs original query each time
Materialized Views : Stores aggregated result physically.


Questions:

How many tables are created in M to M? why?
3 tables
A many-to-many relationship requires 3 tables: the two entity tables and one junction table.
This is because relational databases only support one-to-many relationships directly, so the junction table is needed to connect them.
Ex: Multiple employees working on multiple projects 


Can inner query execute independently?
Sub-query  – Yes
Co-related query – No
